# Outline

## Description from invitation

> ... article related to the topic of Python for data science.
> The article should critically present the current state-of-the-art, include opposing viewpoints, and identify challenges and opportunities.

## Basic Outline

1. Brief history of developments

   - Python's beginnings
   - Shell era
   - SciPy era
   - PyData era

2. Figure: how all the tools fit together

3. Examples from core tools

   - Python
   - Cython
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib (also Seaborn, plotnine)
   - SciPy
   - Scikits (scikit-learn, scikit-image, statsmodels, mention others)
   - Dask
   - Deep Learning (Keras/Tensorflow, PyTorch)
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Conda (mention relationship to pip)
     

4. Areas for growth

   - lack of declarative APIs (cf. dplyr, ggplot in R)
   - warty nature of pandas (example: automatic block consolidation)
   - parallelization & scaling (mention sklearn clones for spark, dask, etc.)
   - dashboard publishing (cf. shiny)
